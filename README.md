# About Project

 -   It should have secure authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized admins can access these functionalities.

**User Interface**:
 -  The frontend, built using React JS and Redux, will provide an intuitive and interactive user experience.
 -   Users can search for products using a search bar and add products to their cart.

**Cart Functionality**:
 -  Users should be able to view and manage their cart, including adding or removing items before checkout.

**Order Placement and Checkout**:
 -  Once users are satisfied with their cart, they can proceed to checkout and place their orders.
 -  Users will need to provide shipping and payment information during the checkout process.

**Payment Gateway Integration**:
 -   The platform should integrate with a secure and reliable payment gateway to process payments from users.
 -   Users should have multiple payment options, such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or other applicable methods.
